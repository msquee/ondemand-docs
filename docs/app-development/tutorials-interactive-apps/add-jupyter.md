Add a Jupyter App {#app-development-tutorials-interactive-apps-add-jupyter}
=================

This tutorial will walk you through creating an interactive Jupyter app
that your users will use to launch a [Jupyter Notebook
Server](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) within a batch job on
a compute node. The user will then be able to connect to the running
server through their browser and take advantage of the resources
provided within the batch job.
