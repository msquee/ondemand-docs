Add a MATLAB App {#app-development-tutorials-interactive-apps-add-matlab}
================

This tutorial will walk you through creating an interactive MATLAB app
that your users will use to launch a
[MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) within a batch
job on a compute node. MATLAB will be launched within the context of an
XFCE desktop to provide a window manager and terminal. The user will
then be able to connect to the application through their browser and
take advantage of the resources provided within the batch job.
