Add an RStudio App {#app-development-tutorials-rstudio}
==================

This tutorial will walk you through creating an interactive RStudio app
that your users will use to launch a [RStudio
Server](https://www.rstudio.com/) within a batch job on a compute node.
The user will then be able to connect to the running server through
their browser and take advantage of the resources provided within the
batch job.
