User Documentation
==================

Currently there is no general user documentation provided.

OSC provides user documentation for their Open OnDemand deployment (OSC
OnDemand) at:

<https://www.osc.edu/resources/online_portals/ondemand>

Feel free to use it as template for your own organization\'s user-facing
documentation.
