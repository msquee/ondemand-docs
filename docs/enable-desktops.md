Enable Interactive Desktop {#enable-desktops}
==========================

This installation guide will walk you through setting up an Interactive
Desktop app that your users will be able to use to launch a Gnome 2,
Mate, or Xfce desktop on a compute node within your HPC cluster. The
user should then be able to connect to a running session through their
browser using the [noVNC](http://novnc.com/info.html) client.
