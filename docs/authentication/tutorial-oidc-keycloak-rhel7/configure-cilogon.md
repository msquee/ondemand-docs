Configure Keycloak with CILogon {#authentication-tutorial-oidc-keycloak-rhel7-configure-cilogon}
===============================

We will now use Keycloak\'s admin Web UI to setup the ability to log
existing users in with CILogon.

When a user logs in with CILogon for the first time they will be
redirected back to Keycloak to log in with their local (ie LDAP)
credentials. This performs a mapping of their CILogon identity with
their Keycloak identity.

Warning
:::

CILogon can only map a single external identity to a Keycloak account.
This means if a user logs in with Institution A they must remove their
mapping in order to log in with Institution B.
:::

Register your Keycloak instance with CILogon
--------------------------------------------

1.  Go to `https://cilogon.org/oauth2/register` and fill out the form

> 1.  The Home URL will be the base URL of your Keycloak instance, eg:
>     `https://ondemand-idpdev.hpc.osc.edu`.
> 2.  The callback URL will be
>     `https://ondemand-idpdev.hpc.osc.edu/auth/realms/<REALM>/broker/cilogon/endpoint`.
>     Replace `https://ondemand-idpdev.hpc.osc.edu` with your Keycloak
>     instance
> 3.  The box for \"Is this a public client?\" should not be checked
> 4.  For \"Scopes\" be sure to check \"profile\" and
>     \"org.cilogon.userinfo\"

You will be provided a Client ID and a Client Secret, be sure to save
these values. Your registered client will not be usable until you
receive an email from CILogon stating your client has been approved.

Support users removing CILogon mappings
---------------------------------------

In order for a user to remove an existing CILogon mapping in Keycloak
they must navigate to
`https://ondemand-idpdev.hpc.osc.edu/auth/realms/<REALM>/account/identity`.
Replace `ondemand-idpdev.hpc.osc.edu` with the web URL for your Keycloak
instance.

The URL can be added to the OnDemand Help dropdown with custom text to
make it easier for users to access their Keycloak identity page.

1.  Add `OOD_DASHBOARD_HELP_CUSTOM_URL` to
    `/etc/ood/config/apps/dashboard/env` that points to the URL of the
    identity page for your Keycloak instance. Example:
    `https://ondemand-idpdev.hpc.osc.edu/auth/realms/osc/account/identity`

2.  Update `/etc/ood/config/locales/en.yml` with the text to be used for
    the Identity provider Help link

    ``` {.}
    en:
      dashboard:
        nav_help_custom: Manage Federated Identity
    ```
