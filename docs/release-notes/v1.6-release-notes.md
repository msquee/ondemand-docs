Details
-------

### OnDemand passed a security audit

At the end of 2018 [TrustedCI](https://trustedci.org/) completed a
security audit of OnDemand and quoting the major findings of the audit:
\"No major issues were found in a comprehensive evaluation of the
architecture and critical resources in Open OnDemand, and analysis of
potential code weaknesses in critical components.\"

Thanks to Elisa Heymann, Joel Atkins and Barton P. Miller for performing
the audit! The full report is available as a PDF at
[openondemand.org](https://openondemand.org/documents/Open%20OnDemand%20Trusted%20CI%20Engagement%20Report.pdf).

### Added job array support for LSF and PBSPro adapters

Job Composer and Active Jobs now support job arrays for all adapters
that OnDemand supports including LSF and PBSPro.

### Improved Slurm and Grid Engine adapters

To improve the reliability of parsing `squeue` output the record
delimiter has been changed from newline to the [ASCII/Unicode record
separator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter#Conventions).

To match the behavior of the other adapters the Grid Engine adapter will
now attempt to detect whether the user has set the working directory of
a job. If the user has not passed the `-wd` or `-cwd` flags in the first
1024 characters of their job script then the adapter will append `-cwd`
to the arguments passed to `qsub`. Fixed error where the Grid Engine
adapter would throw an error when getting information on a job that had
exited the queue.

### Added localization options to the Dashboard and Job Composer

Many more strings have been internationalized in the Dashboard and the
Job Composer. This work does not cover all the strings in the app, but
enables localization of the most important ones.

See `customization_localization`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for
details.

### Added rendering of HTML or Markdown in Job Composer template manifests

If the environment variable `RENDER_TEMPLATE_NOTES_AS_MARKDOWN` is set
to a truthy value then job template manifests displayed in the Job
Composer that are written in Markdown will be run through the RedCarpet
renderer. HTML values will always be rendered as HTML. This will allow
sites to embed images or links to documentation in their templates.
([ood-mjobs\#291](https://github.com/OSC/ood-myjobs/issues/278))

### Added support for fetching quota from a URL

File usage quota warnings displayed on the Dashboard may now use a URL
as their data source. Thanks to Dan Dietz at Purdue for the initial work
on this feature.

### Added VNC quality and compression controls

Controls to change the VNC compression and quality have been added to
interactive session card:

![](/images/interactive-app-compression-quality.png){.align-center}

This can help with users who want to sacrifice quality for a better
connection speed and others who have great connection speed and want to
maximize the quality.

### Open Shell to compute node that a VNC job is running on

For running interactive sessions, the host name becomes a clickable link
to open in the shell app:

![](/images/interactive-app-shell-link.png){.align-center}

### Changed \'Open in Terminal\' button to offer multiple options when OOD\_SSH\_HOSTS is set

In the Files app, if the environment variable `OOD_SSH_HOSTS` is set to
a comma delimited value of `host:title`, then the Open in Terminal
button will display a dropdown of hosts to ssh to, instead of ssh-ing to
the default host. For example, in the image below I set
`OOD_SSH_HOSTS="owens.osc.edu:Owens,pitzer.osc.edu:Pitzer,ruby.osc.edu:Ruby"`:

![](/images/files-open-in-terminal.png){.align-center}

::: {.note}
::: {.title}
Note
:::

In a future version of OnDemand we will change this app to load the
hosts from the cluster configs.
:::

### Enable BatchConnect applications to raise errors after form submission

In the `submit.yml.erb` of an interactive app, if you raise an
exception, the submission process will be aborted and the user will be
shown the error. This enables interactive apps to support basic form
submission validation.

### Added version strings to Dashboard

The Dashboard will now display the version of OnDemand and the Dashboard
in the footer. Interactive applications will display their versions next
to their title on their launch page.

### Changed ngnix\_stage to always remove stale PID files

`nginx_stage clean` will now remove PID and socket files for processes
that are not longer running. Whenever a stale PID files is deleted its
removal is reported on `stderr`.
([ondemand\#11](https://github.com/OSC/ondemand/issues/11))

### Add ability to disable RewriteEngine in Apache config

You can now omit enabling the RewriteEngine by adding
`use_rewrites: false` to the `/etc/ood/config/ood_portal.yml` config
file and re-running the
`sudo /opt/ood/ood-portal-generator/sbin/update_ood_portal` to update
the ood-portal.conf Apache config.

### Many bug fixes

-   Setting the environmental variable `OOD_SHELL` to an empty string
    will now hide the Open in Terminal button as documented.
    ([ood-fileexplorer\#191](https://github.com/OSC/ood-fileexplorer/issues/191))
-   Job Composer logs will no longer contain complaints about gems not
    being eager loaded.
    ([ood-myjobs\#285](https://github.com/OSC/ood-myjobs/issues/285))
-   `nginx_stage` will no longer crash when one of the `pun_custom_env`
    values in `/etc/ood/config/nginx_stage.yml` is a number and not a
    string. ([ondemand\#26](https://github.com/OSC/ondemand/issues/26))
-   In Active Jobs, display nothing in \"Account\" column if no account
    set for the job, instead of displaying `(null)`.
-   Fixed Time Used format for Active Jobs: In 1.5 the `Time Used` field
    in Active Jobs was the number of seconds elapsed as an integer. In
    1.6 this has been changed back to `HH:MM:SS`.
-   Fixed Job Composer layout when job name is long: Job names that were
    exceptionally long and did not contain \'break-able\' punctuation
    could break the layout of the Job Composer\'s data table. The table
    has been updated so that job names wrap and will break mid-word if
    necessary.
-   Fixed Shell App paste issues in MS Edge and Firefox (\#62, \#59, and
    \#64)
