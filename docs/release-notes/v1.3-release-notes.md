Upgrading from v1.2
-------------------

::: {.warning}
::: {.title}
Warning
:::

As always please update the *development* or *test* instances of
OnDemand installed at your center first before you modify the
*production* instance.
:::

::: {.note}
::: {.title}
Note
:::

The steps outlined below will only need to be done once when upgrading
from versions \<= 1.2 to 1.3. Future updates will be handled through the
RPM going forward.
:::

1.  This RPM installation will want to overwrite any local configuration
    or modifications you may have made in earlier versions of OnDemand,
    so we will first start by making backups of OnDemand and our apps:

    ``` {.sh}
    sudo mv /opt/ood /opt/ood.bak
    sudo mv /var/www/ood/apps/sys /var/www/ood/apps/sys.bak
    ```

2.  We have moved all configuration to be located underneath
    `/etc/ood/config`{.interpreted-text role="file"}. This includes the
    YAML configuration file used to generate the Apache configuration
    file, the YAML configuration file used to generate the per-user
    NGINX (PUN) configuration files, and any configuration/customization
    files used for the individual OnDemand core apps.

    So you will want to copy over the configuration files ahead of time
    for best results:

    ``` {.sh}
    sudo cp $HOME/ood/src/ood-portal-generator/config.yml /etc/ood/config/ood_portal.yml
    ```

    ::: {.warning}
    ::: {.title}
    Warning
    :::

    This assumes you were using the
    `ood-portal-generator`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to generate the
    Apache configuration file under
    `/opt/rh/httpd24/root/etc/httpd/conf.d/ood-portal.conf`{.interpreted-text
    role="file"}. If you haven\'t been doing this before then now is a
    good time to start. Feel free to contact us if you have trouble with
    this.

1.  Add Open OnDemand\'s repository hosted by the [Ohio Supercomputer
    Center](https://www.osc.edu/):

    ``` {.sh}
    sudo yum install https://yum.osc.edu/ondemand/1.3/ondemand-release-web-1.3-1.el7.noarch.rpm
    ```

2.  Install OnDemand and all of its dependencies:

    ``` {.sh}
    sudo yum install ondemand
    ```

3.  Copy back any custom apps (e.g., Jupyter, RStudio, \...) you
    installed previously from our backup directory:

    ``` {.sh}
    sudo cp -r /var/www/ood/apps/sys.bak/CUSTOM_APP /var/www/ood/apps/sys/.
    ```

4.  The installation will install all software and web apps. It will
    also generate a new Apache configuration file and restart Apache. So
    if all went well you should be able to access the OnDemand portal in
    your browser successfully.

`v1.3-app-versions`{.interpreted-text role="numref"} lists the versions
as well as the previous version it was updated from for each of the
system web applications in this release.

Details
-------

### RPM based installation

This is the biggest change and constitutes the bulk of this release\'s
work. RPM based installation will now be the default and documented way
to install and update OnDemand. The latest rpms that are in use at OSC
can be accessed from <https://yum.osc.edu/ondemand/latest/> and the
stable releases will be available in specific release version
directories, such as <https://yum.osc.edu/ondemand/1.3/>.

### Store configuration under /etc instead of under app directories

To enable RPM based installation, two modifications have been made to
all configuration for OnDemand:

1.  All configuration can be moved to files under /etc/ood
2.  Modifications to configuration only require Passenger app, Per User
    NINGX, or Apache server restart (with the exception of the
    ood-portal-generater config)

Since all configuration is stored under /etc/ood this directory can be
easily managed by Puppet or versioned in a git repository.

### Config changes no longer require app rebuilds

It is now much faster to make and test configuration changes. For most
configuration changes, you can make the change and then select \"Restart
Web Server\" from the \"Help\" or \"Develop\" dropdown to see the
change.

### Xfce support Interactive Desktops

We now have documentation for enabling Xfce 4+ as the desktop
environment for OnDemand Interactive Desktops. Xfce is the desktop
environment we now use internally at OSC. See
`enable-desktops-modify-form-attributes`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
for documentation on how to use Xfce in OnDemand.

### Cluster config verification script

A Rake task has been added to the Dashboard app that will submit and
check the status of jobs for each cluster specified in the cluster
config. This provides a quick way to verify that OnDemand has been
properly configured for a new cluster and should speed up installation.
See `resource-manager-test`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} in the cluster
configuration documentation for more details.

### Ignore apps if they have a period in directory name

You can effectively hide apps from being displayed in the Dashboard by
adding a period in the app\'s directory name. This is useful if you want
to make a backup of an app, e.g., `../myapp.bak/`{.interpreted-text
role="file"}. Or just want to include a hidden directory in the app
deployment directory, e.g., `../.hidden-app/`{.interpreted-text
role="file"}.

### Enable multiple Dashboard announcements with embedded HTML

Site-wide dashboard announcement support in OnDemand has been expanded.
Orinally we supported a file `/etc/ood/config/announcement.md` but now a
YAML file `/etc/ood/config/announcement.yml` can be used. A collection
of markdown and yaml announcements in `/etc/ood/config/announcements.d/`
can be added. The yaml file provides extra benefits:

1.  Pre process file using ERB so that ERB tags can provide per-request
    dynamic modification of the announcement
2.  Control the color of announcement with `:type` which is the
    Bootstrap alert name (`warning`, `info`, `success`, or `danger`)
3.  Control whether announcement appears or not by setting `:msg` to a
    string or `nil`

The ability to use ERB means we can set the msg to nil after a certain
time period. For example:

``` {.erb}
type: warning
msg: |
  <%- if Time.now < Time.new(2018, 1, 23, 15, 0, 0) -%>
  **NOTICE:** The Ruby nodes on the Quick cluster will go down on Tuesday
  January 23, 2018 from 1 - 3 pm for scheduled maintenance. This will affect
  only **Ruby VDI** sessions scheduled to run during this time period. These
  sessions will be put on hold until after the maintenance period is complete.
  <%- end -%>
```

In this example, the announcement appears on the dashboard until Jan 23
at 3:00. We\'ll add more documentation for this soon. If you want to
take advantage of this now just ask a question on the ood-users mailing
list.

### Open \"help\" links in new window

Currently, any app that is served by a separate Passenger process,
external to the Dashboard app, is opened in a new window. Thus, Shell
Access, Files, Active Jobs, and Job Composer all open in new windows.
Interactive App Plugins are managed by the Dashboard so they open in the
same window. We fixed the external links in the Help menu to follow this
convention.

### Make \"Interactive Sessions\" link top level item

The Interactive Sessions link was moved from the first item in the
Interactive Apps menu to a top level item on the navbar. Since these
apps are one of the pprimary ways users use OnDemand this makes access
to active sessions require one less click. Also, this frees us to place
links to Interactive Apps anywhere in the navigation hierarchy without
having to provide an associated sessions link in the same place.

### Better debugging of Interactive Apps by logging shell commands

Whenever an Interactive Session is started from the Dashboard, the shell
command used to submit the job is logged to the user\'s NGINX config to
help with debugging Interactive Apps.

### Job Composer: Optionally hide Account field in Job Options

The Job Composer provides a field in the Job Options form to set the
Account, which when the job is submitted uses the appropriate account
flag for the resource manager (whether it is `-A` or `-P` or
`--account`, etc.). However, some sites do not use this, and others use
different mechanisms for accounting. Long term we want to support
flexible configuration of this web form, but for now we have added the
ability to hide this Account field from the web form. This field is
hidden by adding to the Job Composer\'s env file:
`OOD_SHOW_JOB_OPTIONS_ACCOUNT_FIELD=0`

### Active Jobs: display list of nodes that a job is running on

In Active Jobs, if the resource manager provides it, the list of nodes a
job is running on will display in the details section of the job.
