Open OnDemand
=============

Our [website](https://osc.github.io/Open-OnDemand/) contains general
information about the Open OnDemand project.

Community contributions
-----------------------

Throughout this documentation we will start highlighting community
contributions to the project, including linking to external useful
projects or extensions such as [PSC\'s Jupyter Notebook
extension](https://github.com/PSC-PublicHealth/pha-nbextensions) for
manipulating the environment post launch.

:::info Note

If you have an app or extension that may be useful to others in the
OnDemand community please share on our
[Discourse](https://discourse.osc.edu/c/open-ondemand) instance and we
can then also add it to this documentation site.
